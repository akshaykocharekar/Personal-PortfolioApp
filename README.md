# 🚀 Personal Portfolio (Customized from Magic UI Template)

This is my personal portfolio website, built by customizing a Magic UI template.  
I have 🛠️ extended, modified, and integrated new features to make it my own.  
🎨 Credit goes to the original Magic UI team for the base design inspiration.
