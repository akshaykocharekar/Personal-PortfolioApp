summary: "A beginner-friendly breakdown of the MERN stack and why it's the backbone of so many modern web apps."

The MERN stack stands for **MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js** â€” a powerful combo for building full-stack web applications.

Each part of the stack plays a unique role:

- **MongoDB** handles your database.
- **Express.js** manages backend routing and logic.
- **React** builds your interactive front-end.
- **Node.js** powers the backend JavaScript runtime.

```js
// Example: Express.js basic route
app.get("/api", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello from backend!");
});
```
